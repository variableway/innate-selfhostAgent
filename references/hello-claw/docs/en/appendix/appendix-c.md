## 3. Self-Hosted vs. Managed: Decision Framework

Once you've chosen your scenario, the next step is deciding **how to deploy**. The following framework helps you choose between four deployment modes:

| Dimension | Self-Hosted (Main tutorial path) | Desktop Client | Cloud Provider One-Click | Fully Managed SaaS |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Representative** | OpenClaw manual install | AutoClaw / ClawX | Tencent Cloud / Alibaba Cloud, etc. | ArkClaw / Kimi Claw |
| **Control** | ★★★★★ Full control | ★★★★☆ Mostly | ★★★★☆ Mostly | ★★☆☆☆ Limited |
| **Ops cost** | Must maintain yourself | Nearly zero | Semi-managed | Zero ops |
| **Monthly cost** | Electricity / VPS only | Free / buy credits as needed | ¥10–100/month | ¥10–300/month |
| **Data sovereignty** | Fully local | Local | Cloud (controllable) | Cloud (limited) |
| **Flexibility** | ★★★★★ Highest | ★★★☆☆ Medium | ★★★★☆ High | ★★☆☆☆ Lowest |
| **Learning curve** | ★★★☆☆ Requires terminal | ★☆☆☆☆ Download and use | ★★☆☆☆ Buy and use | ★☆☆☆☆ Register and use |
| **Who it's for** | Technical users who want to learn in depth | Zero-experience users | Users who want convenience but retain control | Users who just want to use it |

**Decision Recommendations:**

> - 🎯 **Beginner's first choice**: AutoClaw (zero barrier) → then migrate to OpenClaw (full control) once familiar
> - 💰 **Lowest budget**: ClawX or OneClaw + StepFun free models (zero cost)
> - 🔒 **Security first**: IronClaw self-hosted (WASM sandbox + zero telemetry)
> - 🏢 **Enterprise use**: WorkBuddy (WeChat ecosystem) / ArkClaw (Feishu ecosystem)
> - 🤖 **Multi-agent**: HiClaw (Manager-Worker architecture)

**How to choose?**

- **AutoClaw**: Best for zero-experience users — download, register, start chatting, never touch a terminal. Built-in models mean no API key needed. Downsides: locked into Zhipu ecosystem, no Linux version.
- **ClawX**: Best for users who want a GUI without being locked into any ecosystem. Open-source + three platforms + provider of your choice. Includes the OpenClaw runtime, no need to install Node.js separately.
- **OneClaw**: An open-source desktop client with a similar positioning to ClawX, also supporting three platforms + provider of your choice. Suitable for users who prefer a lightweight open-source GUI.
- **LobsterAI**: Made by NetEase Youdao, China's first fully MIT open-source desktop Agent. 16 built-in skills + 5,000+ in the skill store + 15+ MCP marketplace services, broadest IM coverage (DingTalk/Feishu/WeCom/QQ/Telegram/Discord), Alpine VM sandbox isolation, 100% local data, no ads. Best for users who want **open-source + security + broad IM support**.
- **EasyClaw**: Made by Cheetah Mobile, Fu Sheng's signature "Three Wan" skill pack, double-click install zero-config. Has a mobile app (iOS/Android), can connect directly to Feishu, WeCom, DingTalk, QQ, and other common work apps. Best for **company office work, marketing operations, and cross-border expansion**.
- **YuanqiAIBot**: Also made by Cheetah Mobile, positioned as a "domestic OpenClaw", focused on file handling (PDF/Word/PPT parsing), system operations (mouse/keyboard control, software installation), and office creation (writing/PPT generation/transcription), with remote control via Feishu/DingTalk.
- **Molili**: Made by Dangbei, a desktop client with deep Chinese language optimization, connected to Chinese models (DeepSeek, MiniMax, Qwen, Kimi, Zhipu GLM), supports WeChat remote PC control + VLA visual manipulation.
- **QoderWork**: Made by Alibaba, a locally-running desktop Agent supporting three modes: Ask (Q&A), Agent (auto-execution), Quest (complex tasks), with MCP protocol + custom Skills.
- **BocLaw**: Made by Bocloud, an AI collaboration platform for developers and knowledge workers, full platform support (including Web sandbox mode), 100% local data, supports private cloud and air-gapped deployment, free for individuals.

> Chapter 1 of this tutorial covers the [AutoClaw installation process](/en/adopt/chapter1/) in detail. ClawX, OneClaw, and LobsterAI installation is also mentioned as alternatives in Chapter 1.
