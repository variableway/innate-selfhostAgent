## 2. Start a Conversation

![AutoClaw initial interface](./images/autoclaw.png)

There are four preset agents on the left. Click any one to start chatting:

| Agent | One-line description | How to use |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| **AutoClaw** | General-purpose assistant — handles anything | Describe your goal directly |
| **Deep Research** | In-depth research | Fill in the research direction inside the 【】 brackets in the prompt |
| **Monitor** | Scheduled reminders | Enter the time and the subject to monitor (e.g., a stock ticker) |
| **Browser Agent** | Browser control | Describe what you want it to do on a webpage |

During a conversation you can upload files (click 📎) or paste a URL — the agent will automatically read and index them. Uploaded files appear in the **Files** sidebar on the right.

<details>
<summary>What is each agent best suited for?</summary>

**AutoClaw** — General-purpose assistant. Chat about anything, get anything done. The interface prompt reads: "Describe your goal. AutoClaw will execute step by step and stream back progress."

**Deep Research** — An in-depth research expert. When you open it you'll see the pre-set prompt:

> I want to conduct in-depth research on: 【】. Please help me: 1. Break down the problem from multiple angles; 2. Search Chinese and English sources, cross-validate data; 3. Produce a structured, data-backed, independently insightful deep report.

Simply fill in the research direction inside the 【】 brackets.

**Monitor** — A scheduled monitoring expert. Pre-set prompt:

> Set up a scheduled task to tell me 【at what time every day】 the closing price of 【】 【stock ticker:】 for that day, with a brief analysis.

Fill in the time and the subject to monitor, and it will automatically create a scheduled task. Created tasks appear in the **Cron Jobs** tab on the left.

**Browser Agent** — A browser control expert (integrated with AutoGLM Browser-Use). Pre-set prompt:

> Search Xiaohongshu for the most popular posts about lobster, pick five, compile the post content, like counts, and top three comments into an Excel file, save it to the desktop, and name it "Post Summary".

You can modify this prompt to suit your actual needs and have it complete any multi-step, cross-page browser task.

## 3. Quick Setup: Let the Agent Get to Know You

A **Quick Setup** card will pop up before your first conversation. Take 30 seconds to fill it in so the agent knows who you are and what you're good at:

![Quick Setup](./images/autoclaw-agent-quick-setup.png)

Enter your name, your role, give the agent a name, and choose your areas of expertise, then click **Done**. If you skip this, no worries — just tell the agent in conversation at any time and it will configure itself.

<details>
<summary>What to fill in for each field?</summary>

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **What should we call you?** | Your name | Hello-Claw |
| **Your role** (optional) | Your role / occupation | Teaching Guide |
| **What should I be called?** (optional) | Give the agent a name | Qiwan |
| **Focus areas** | Choose the agent's areas of expertise (multiple selections allowed) | Coding / Writing / Product / Data Analysis / Design / DevOps / Research / Marketing / Teaching / Other |
| **Working Directory** | The agent's working directory | `~/.openclaw-autoclaw/workspace` |
| **Restrict File Access** | When enabled, the agent can only read and write files within the working directory | Recommended: enable |
| **Optimization Plan** | Optimization plan (experimental feature) | Off by default |

Once the setup is complete, the agent's configuration is displayed in the info panel on the right. If you're not satisfied, adjust it through conversation until you are.
